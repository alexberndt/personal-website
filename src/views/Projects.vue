    <publication-card
      name="Receding Horizon Re-ordering of Multi-Agent Execution Schedules"
      link="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04190"
      highlight_author="Alexander Berndt"
      other_authors="Niels Van Duijkeren, Luigi Palmieri, Alexander Kleiner, Tamas Keviczky"
      abstract="We propose an optimization-based receding horizon feedback control scheme to re-order AGVs subject
                to delays when executing Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) plans.  
                When compared to the state-of-the-art MAPF planners, our approach yields a
                significant reduction in cumulative route completion times for AGVs subjected 
                to large delays, often experienced in uncertain environments with dynamic obstacles"

      nonhighlight_first_author="Amr Alanwar, "
      highlight_author="Alexander Berndt"
      other_authors="Karl Henrik Johansson, Henrik Sandberg"
      abstract="We propose a method to perform set-based state estimation 
                of an unknown dynamical system using a data-driven set propagation function.
                Our method has proven set-containment guarantees given bounds on the 
                observed input signals."

                (AGVs) navigating a common workspace to fulfill 
                various intralogistics tasks. We propose a novel, 
                online persistent optimization scheme to reduce route 
                completion times when AGVs are subject to delays.
